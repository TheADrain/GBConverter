TODO - GB IMG CONVERTER and GUI

Export Fixes! top priority

- avoid extern keyword (don't think we're using this tbh)
- overhaul command line version in order to support better asset building toolchain
- document the command line functionality! 
- think about uploading this bitch to github

GUI Niceties
- optional grid overlay for preview tiles

Map Builder (future want, for now used Tiled and the MapConverter functionality)
- create the form
- add a toggle for bgmap mode and collision (square tiles only) mode
- create map button to kick things off
- map name
- save map data/serialization
- load map data function
- map create window: name, width, height, include collision plane (tickbox)
- export to map format used in the image converter but with additional collision plane data
- on creation fill map with tile 0 (mostly automatic as the array will initialize to this)
- scrollbar for window to account for larger maps
- click to get grid position calculation
- tile selection functionality
- tile paint with left click func
- click and drag to draw a box?
Future thoughts:
- Save delta to enable undo functionality

Functionality
- add functionality for multiple tileplanes in tile maps (with plane names etc)
		- this is sort of done, we have support for one collision plane
		- might want to add a 'things' plane that has game objects by id

Code Cleanup
- consolidate the optional shit into an export config class to pass around

GUI Functionality
- show number of bytes total in the data (accounting for things such as leading byte for tilecount)
- optional header info (data start/end label, num tiles label, width/height in tiles label)
- redesign the img convert page once this is done to lay out the information in a nicer way

Other
- At least try to maintain compatability with command line version of the tool? :S

----DONE----
- use /* */ for all exported C/H file comments, as // is not supported properly by SDCC
- optionally generate header files for exports to C (for optimisation and bank switching)
- added Tiled import functionality from csv
- added collision planes to tilemaps
- add a way to load a tileset from img converter
- make a tilemap class to hold the tilemap and its data such as width/height (and in future additional planes)
- add optional byte to tilemaps for width/height in tiles
- GBDK C format export (C array code generated) for MAP and TILES
- hook up the ASM export code that already exists in the old program for MAP and TILES
- show tileset data better (num tiles, num duplicate tiles, etc) after preview regenerated
- dropdown for export type should be functional (export to ASM, BIN and GBDK C formats)
- export button functionality for img conversion
- duplicate tiles keep/remove functionality via tickbox
- implement bitmap export for tileset and final image (just incase you want it for some reason...)
- Implement custom picturebox class that supports nearest neighbor filtering on zoom/stretch
- show tileset data (num tiles generated)
